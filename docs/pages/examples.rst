Examples
=========

This section is all about showing how each different type has been used to create some kind of geometry,
the geometry isn't intended to be sensible - and in some cases methods were simply taken advantage of. The
format is almost exactly like the benchmarks section however separation was required as the benchmarks
are indeed important whereas these just show how things can be done.
