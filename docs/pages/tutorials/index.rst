Tutorials
==========

There is an infinite amount of creativity a user can access though just a few basic functions,
these tutorials outline how to make some of the common IGES examples you find around the web.
However firstly, lets discuss how to get started:

Getting Started
----------------

Getting started with pyiges is as simple as doing ``import pyiges``


'Real Examples'
----------------

Real is open to interpretation, however the following show how to achieve standard example files.
This is important because, it's possible to make anything - but it's hard to make something. For
instance, we could design several cars and say 'oh this library is awesome' however that does
not show anything - it's more important to show that it's possible to generate benchmark files.
