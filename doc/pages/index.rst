The following seconds discuss how to get going with |project|

The following sections are specifically about the development and source code of the project. Make reference to :ref:`genindex` and :ref:`modindex` which provides a general and module index respectively.

Finally these sections detail some of the not so entertaining side of things, bugs and licenses. Note that because this program is AFL we have performed due diligence and disclosed the licenses for every program that was considered to be included. It's unknown if this is enough to satisfy the requirements of AFL (which puts the onus on the development team to disclose this information)
